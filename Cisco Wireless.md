## Channel Width

| **Channel Width** | **Throughput**     | **Interference Risk**    | **Best Use Case**                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **20 MHz**        | Lower (~150 Mbps)  | Low (more channels)      | High-density environments          |
| **40 MHz**        | Medium (~300 Mbps) | Medium (fewer channels)  | Moderate-density, low interference |
| **80 MHz**        | High (~600+ Mbps)  | High (very few channels) | Low-density, high-speed needs      |

## Min Req

- -67dbm
- Each AP 15 devices (usually 20-25)
- 2 controllers (guest, corporate)

## Pre Survey

- Client > CM > Pre-Sales
- Walk the ground
	- Best signal strength, coverage, least interference
- More AP
	- Good for coverage
	- Bad for interference

## Post Survey

- Tech Refresh
- 1 to 1 replace
- Grey = many interference, but if -67 dbm, has little to no effect

## Other

- 2.4Ghz (3) vs 5Ghz (24 - 3 by government)
	- 5: Weaker through walls, higher speed, lower interference

## Models

- C3802I-S-K9
	- I = internal, E =  external
	- S = Singapore
